# Ideas

Store your brainstorming and project ideas here.

## Getting Started
Use the idea template from `templates/idea-template.md` for serious ideas you want to develop.

For quick thoughts, just use `../scratch.txt` first.

## Naming Convention
Descriptive names:
- `ai-powered-code-reviewer.md`
- `personal-finance-tracker-app.md`
- `automated-testing-framework.md`

## From Idea to Reality
1. **Capture** - Quick notes in scratch.txt
2. **Develop** - Move to ideas/ with full template
3. **Plan** - Fill out the planning sections
4. **Execute** - Create project note and start building!

## Tips
- Don't filter yourself - capture all ideas
- Review monthly to see what resonates
- Link related ideas together
- Track ideas you've completed
- Note why some ideas didn't work out
